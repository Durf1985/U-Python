Write a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible on jump host, an inventory is already present under
/home/thor/ansible directory on Jump host itself. Perform below given tasks using this playbook:
We have a file /opt/sysops/blog.txt on app server 1. Using Ansible replace module replace string
xFusionCorp to Nautilus in that file.
We have a file /opt/sysops/story.txt on app server 2.Using Ansiblereplace module replace
the string Nautilus to KodeKloud in that file.

We have a file /opt/sysops/media.txt on app server 3. Using Ansible replace module
replace string KodeKloud to xFusionCorp Industries in that file.

Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
